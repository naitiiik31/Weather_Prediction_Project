🌦️ Weather Prediction Project

📌 Overview

The Weather Prediction Project uses Machine Learning to analyze historical weather data and predict future temperature and humidity values.
This web-based system is built using Django, Python, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas.

The model forecasts the next few days' weather using trained Random Forest algorithms.
Users can simply open the web interface, enter the required details, and view predictions in real time.
