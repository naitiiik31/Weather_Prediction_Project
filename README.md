# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Project
## 📌 Overview
The Weather Prediction Project uses Machine Learning to analyze historical weather data and predict future temperature and humidity values. This web-based system is built using Django, Python, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, and Pandas. The model forecasts upcoming weather conditions using a trained Random Forest Regression algorithm. Users can access a simple web interface, enter the required details, and view predictions in real time.
